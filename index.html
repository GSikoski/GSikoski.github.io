                <p> 
                    Psychology aims to understand individuals' thoughts, emotions, and behaviors through observation, experimentation, and analysis.<br><br>
                    Key Goals of Psychology:<br>
                    
                    Describe: What is happening? Psychologists observe and describe behaviors.<br>
                    Explain: Why is it happening? Theories are developed to explain causes.<br>
                    Predict: When will it happen again? Predictions are based on patterns and previous research.<br>
                    Control: Can we change behavior? Psychologists develop techniques to influence or control behavior (e.g., therapy).<br><br>
                    Major Branches of Psychology:<br>
                    
                    Biological Psychology: Focuses on how the brain, nervous system, and other biological factors influence behavior.<br>
                    Example: How neurotransmitters affect mood and behavior.<br><br>
                    Cognitive Psychology: Studies mental processes such as memory, thinking, problem-solving, and language.<br><br>
                    Developmental Psychology: Examines growth and development across the lifespan.<br>
                    Example: Piaget's stages of cognitive development.<br><br>
                    Social Psychology: Investigates how individuals are influenced by social environments and interactions.<br>
                    Example: Conformity and obedience (Milgram's experiment).<br><br>
                    Important Psychological Perspectives:<br>
                    
                    Behaviorism: Focuses on observable behavior and how it's shaped by the environment (Skinner, Pavlov).<br>
                    Psychoanalysis: Founded by Freud; focuses on unconscious motivations and early childhood experiences.<br>
                    Humanistic Psychology: Emphasizes personal growth and free will (Rogers, Maslow).<br>
                    Cognitive Psychology: Emphasizes the role of mental processes in understanding behavior.</p>
